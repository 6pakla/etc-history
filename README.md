# History of Ethereum Classic

This repository contains the historical data regarding Ethereum Classic.

I've decided to break the history down in 4 phases to make it a bit easier to grasp the high level
of what was happening and through which stages the currency went.

## Chapters

- [Birth - Ethereum network early days](/chapters/birth.md)

- [Struggle - The DAO nightmare](/chapters/struggle.md)

- [Recovery - Showing signs of life](/chapters/recovery.md)

- [Rise - Decentralized teams forming around it](/chapters/rise.md)


I hope you all learn something new. Feel free to fork and open a Pull Request and contribute to the history repository.
