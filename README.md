# History of Ethereum Classic

This repository contains the historical data regarding Ethereum Classic.

I've decided to write a little bit about the history of ETC because right now the information is
pretty scattered and you have to search for old reddit articles, youtube videos, and others resources
to find the information about ETC's past. Sometimes you'll even think you know the history only to
later find out there was so much more, but the resources you've read did not mention any of it.

I'm sure there are many things I don't yet know, some of the stories could be inaccurate and I've
probably forgotten many things that should be mentioned. This is why I've decided to share write it as
a collection of markdown files and put them in a GitHub repository to encourage others to contribute.

The story of ETC is very interesting - better than many movies I've watched - so I encourage you to read it.

I've decided to break the history down in 4 phases to make it a bit easier to grasp the high level
of what was happening and through which stages the currency went.
