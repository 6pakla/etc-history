# Recovery - Showing signs of life

ETC community [declares its independence](https://ethereumclassic.github.io/assets/ETC_Declaration_of_Independence.pdf) [[1]](http://archive.is/9agND) in August 2016.
>Let it be known to the entire world that on July 20th, 2016, at block 1,920,000, we as a community of sovereign
individuals stood united by a common vision to continue the original Ethereum blockchain that is truly free from
censorship, fraud or third party interference. In realizing that the blockchain represents absolute truth, we stand
by it, supporting its immutability and its future. We do not make this declaration lightly, nor without forethought to
the consequences of our actions.

A lot of volunteers continue to support the now called Ethereum Classic chain despite the chain going through very rough times.
On February 20th 2017, Igor Artamonov founds a company called **ETCDEV** whose focus is on improving developer tools for Ethereum Classic Smart Contract
developers and contributing to the [go-ethereum classic client](https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum). The team consists of some of the volunteers
that were already helping the ETC community. Similarly, Charles Hoskinson who had worked for Ethereum in the past, hires a [team of 7 developers](https://iohk.io/projects/ethereum-classic/#team) [[1]](http://archive.is/akZim)
from Poland to start writing a completely new Ethereum Classic client from scratch. The team is known as **Team Grothendieck** named after a French mathematician
Alexander Grothendieck. In an interview with Crypto Baron, [he explains his view on the DAO hard fork](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjKtkjnzcOk).


## Changes to the Ethereum Classic protocol

Ethereum Classic community decides to implement a Monetary Policy similar to that of Bitcoin. It was proposed by Matthew 'snaproll' Mazur in
[ECIP-1017](https://github.com/ethereumproject/ECIPs/blob/master/ECIPs/ECIP-1017.md)

>This ECIP proposes a solution to the Ethereum Classic Monetary Policy to adjust, with finality, the current emission schedule implementation of 14.0625ETC per block in perpetuity. The solution proposed introduces a theoretical upper bound on the maximum absolute number of ETC and introduces a method of degraded emission over time.

The total amount of ETC in circulation will be going towards 230 million but doing it increasingly slower due to block reward reductions
that are scheduled in advance. The first block reduction happened at block 5000000 which was mined in March 2017. You can check when the next block
reduction will happen on [a website](http://ecip1017.com/) that has a countdown to it.

Another important change that was done was disabling the difficulty bomb. Difficulty bomb was a piece of code in Ethereum clients that was put in the client
by Ethereum Foundation with the intention to force them to work and implement a Proof of Stake solution and complete it in time. Essentially what it does is that after some time, it starts making mining increasingly difficult. Why would you force yourself to follow your roadmap by putting bombs in your schedule is still a mistery to me. ETC community decided to first [delay the difficulty bomb](https://github.com/ethereumproject/ECIPs/blob/master/ECIPs/ECIP-1010.md)
because the community was not convinced whether it was good to rush with a Proof of Stake consensus. Later it turned out majority thought the current
implementations of Proof of Stake algorithms are not secure enough and that ETC will stay on Proof of Work until the community agrees to switch over - if they switch over. Instead of delaying the difficulty bomb again, [another ECIP](https://github.com/ethereumproject/ECIPs/blob/master/ECIPs/ECIP-1041.md) came in to remove the difficulty bomb altogether which was accepted and later implemented.

>As Ethereum Classic Mainnet is not planed to migrate to PoS in near future there is no reason to have it and the Difficulty Bomb should be removed to avoid collapse of the network.


## Positive events start happening

A stream of positive events starts happening in the early half a year. Just to name a few:
* A new podcast is started called [Let's talk ETC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J35gvnA-L2c&index=58&list=PLKO8sMfwkZQqGH3Ny2OJ_SRcAvSf_0gx5)
* Grayscale announces [Ethereum Classic Investment Trust](https://grayscale.co/ethereum-classic-investment-trust/)
* A group of volunteers donates to a [Phoenix project](https://github.com/ethereumproject/phoenix-project) that gives us style guideliness, a new ETC logo and the phoenix mascot
* Whatisgravity comes back for a short period of time to [announce he has been working on a project](https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/comments/6gwbcu/i_have_been_working_on_an_etc_project_i_did_not/) [[1]](http://archive.is/zUMLw) for Ethereum Classic
* First [ETC Summit](https://etcsummit.com/2017-summit/) is announced and said to be held in Hong Kong
* A bunch of exchanges start listing ETC

Ethereum Classic community started to recover from the initial social attacks that happened mostly due to many articles falsely reporting on the DAO
hack without really having any understanding of it.


## Summary

1. ETCDEV team gets founded
2. IOHK founds a team for ETC called team Grothendieck
3. ETC gets limited coin issuance and removes difficulty bomb
4. A bunch of events signaling recovery take place
